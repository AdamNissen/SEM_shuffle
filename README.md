Data pipeline used to modify standard outputs from the Oxford Instruments INCA software for easy import into QGIS. This script collects microspatial information from .tif-hdr header files produced by the INCA software when exporting any .tif of an electromicrograph. The microspatial data is then rewritten to a .tfw "word" file, which QGIS will read when its companion .tif file is imported into QGIS. Additionally, this script moves all .tif and .twf files to an output repository.

DEV NOTE: There is currently an issue with the processing method for EDS data (which would have been collected concurrently with any electromicrographs). These data should be collated and translated to match the microspatial information contained in .twf files while a .csv is produced in the output folder. A bug fix is underway, this functionality will return.
